# Philosophy
The reporting tools used here are based on a number of lessons learned
from the intersection of the fields of statistical graphics, graphic
design, and cognitive psychology, especially from the work of Bill Cleveland,
Ralph McGill, John Tukey, Edward Tufte, and Jacques Bertin.

1. Whenever largely numerical information is displayed, graphs convey the information most often needed much better than tables.
    1. Tables usually show more precision than is warranted by the sample information while hiding important features.
    1. Graphics are much better than tables for seeing patterns and anomalies. 
1. The best graphics are ones that make use of features that humans are most accurate in perceiving, namely position along a common scale.
1. Information across multiple data categories is usually easier to judge when the categories are sorted by the numeric quantity underlying the information^[This also facilitates multivariate understanding of trends and differences.  For example, if one sorted countries by the fraction of subjects who died and displayed also the fraction of subjects who suffered a stroke, the extent to which stroke incidence is also sorted by country is a measure of the correlation between mortality and stroke incidence across countries.].
1. The most robust and informative descriptive statistics for continuous variables are quantiles and whole distribution summaries^[In particular, the standard deviation is not very meaningful for asymmetric distributions, and is not robust to outliers.].
1. For group comparisons, confidence intervals for individual means, medians, or proportions are not very useful, and whether or not two confidence intervals overlap is not the correct statistical approach for judging the significance of the difference between the two.  The half-width of the confidence interval for the difference, when centered at the midpoint of the two estimates, provides a succinct precision display, and this half-interval touches the two estimates if and only if there is no significant difference between the two.
1. Each graphic needs a marker that provides the reader with a sense of exactly what fraction of the sample is being analyzed in that graphic. 
1. Tables are best used as backups to graphics.
1. Tables should emphasize estimates that are not functions of the sample size.  For categorical variables, proportions have interpretations independent of sample size so they are the featured estimates, and numerators and denominators are subordinate to the proportions.  For continuous variables, minimum and maximum, while useful for data quality checking, are not population parameters, and they expand as nâ†‘, so they are not proper summary statistics.
1. With the availability of graphics that over hover text, it is more effective to produce tabular information on demand.  The software used here will pop-up tabular information related to the point or group currently pointed to by the mouse.  This makes it less necessary to produce separate tables.

# Notation

## Figure Captions
Needles represent the fraction of observations used in the current
analysis.  The first needle (red) shows the fraction of enrolled
patients used.  If randomization was taken into account, a second
needle (green) represents the fraction of randomized subjects included
in the analysis.  When the analyses consider treatment assignment, two
more needles may be added to the display, showing, respectively, the
fraction of subjects randomized to treatment A used in the analysis
and the fraction of subjects on treatment B who were analyzed.  The
colors of these last two needles are the colors used for the two
treatments throughout the report.  The following table shows some
examples.

```{r needledefs}
# Store using short variable names so Rmarkdown table column
# width will not be wider than actually needed
d1 <- dNeedle(1)
d2 <- dNeedle((3:4)/4)
d3 <- dNeedle((1:2)/4)
d4 <- dNeedle(c(1,2,3,1)/4)
```

|Signpost   | Interpretation |
|------- | -------------------------------------------------|
| `r d1` | All enrolled subjects analyzed, randomization not considered|
| `r d2` | Analysis uses `r frac(3,4)` of enrolled subjects, and all randomized subjects|
| `r d3` | Analysis uses `r frac(1,4)` of enrolled subjects, and `r frac(1,2)` of randomized subjects|
| `r d4` | Same as previous example, and in addition the analysis utilized treatment assignment, analyzing `r frac(3,4)` of those randomized to A and `r frac(1,4)` of those randomized to B|

## Dot Charts
Dot charts are used to present stratified proportions.  Details, including all numerators and denominators of proportions, can be revealed by hovering the mouse over a point.

## Survival Curves
Graphs containing pairs of Kaplan-Meier survival curves show a shaded
region centered at the midpoint of the two survival estimates and
having a height equal to the half-width of the approximate 0.95 pointwise
confidence interval for the difference of the two survival
probabilities.  Time points at which the two survival estimates do not
touch the shaded region denote approximately significantly different
survival estimates, without any multiplicity correction.  Hover the mouse to see numbers of subjects at risk at a specific follow-up time, and more information.

# Introduction
This is a sample of the part of a closed meeting Data Monitoring
Committee report that contains software generated results.  Components
related to efficacy, study design, data monitoring
plan,^[Lan-DeMets monitoring bounds can be plotted using the open source R `gsDesign` package.] summary of previous closed report, interpretation, protocol changes, screening, eligibility, and waiting time until treatment commencement
are not included in this example^[See Ellenberg, Fleming, and DeMets, _Data Monitoring Committees in Clinical Trials_ (Wiley, 2002), pp. 73-74 for recommended components in open and closed data monitoring committee reports.].  This report used a random sample of safety data from a randomized clinical trial.  Randomization date, dropouts, and compliance variables were simulated, the latter two not
being made consistent with the presence or absence of actual data in the random sample.  The date and time that the analysis file used here was last updated was`r datadate`.  Source analysis files were last updated on `primarydatadate`.

# Computing Environment
These analyses were done using the following versions of R[@Rsystem], the
operating system, and add-on packages `hreport`,
`Hmisc`[@Hmisc], `rms`[@rrms], and others:
```{r echo=FALSE}
print(sessionInfo(), locale=FALSE)
```
The reproducible research framework `knitr`[@knitrbook] was used.

# Programming
## Methods
This report was produced using high-quality open source, freely
available R packages.  High-level R graphics and html making functions in FE Harrell's `Hmisc` package were used in the context of the R `knitr` package and `RStudio` with `Rmarkdown`.  A new R package `hreport` contains functions `accrualReport`, `dReport`, `exReport`, `eReport`, and `survReport` using the philosophy of program-controlled generation of html and markdown text, figures, and tables.  When figures were plotted in R, figure legends were automatically generated.

The entire process is best managed by creating a single `.Rmd` file that is executed using the `knitr` package in R.

## Data Preparation
Variable labels are used in much of the graphical and tabular output,
so it is advisable to attach `label` attributes to almost all
variables.  Variable names are used when `label`s are not
defined.  Units of measurement also appear in the output, so most
continuous variables should have a `units` attribute.  The
`units` may contain mathematical expressions such as `cm^2`
which will be properly typeset in tables and plots, using
superscripts, subscripts, etc.  Variables that are not binary (0/1,
`Y/N`, etc.) but are categorical should have `levels` (value
labels) defined (e.g., using the `factor` function) that will be
attractive in the report.  The Hmisc library `upData` function is
useful for annotating variables with labels, units of measurement, and
value labels.  See
[Alzola and Harrell, 2006](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/RS/sintro.pdf), [this](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/StatGraphCourse), and
[this](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/StatCompCourse) for details
about setting up analysis files.

R code that created the analysis file for this report is in the `inst/tests` directory of the `hreport` package source.  For this particular application, `units` and some of the `labels` were actually obtained from separate data tables
as shown in the code.

### Data Assumptions
1. Non-randomized subjects are marked by missing data of randomization
1. The treatment variable is always the same for every dataset and is defined in `tx.var` on `sethreportOption`.
1. For some graphics there must be either no treatment variable or exactly two treatment levels.
1. If there are treatments the design is a parallel-dReport(age + group design.
1. Whenever a dataset is specified to one of the `hreport` functions and subject have repeated measurements ($>1$ record), an `id` variable must be given.
